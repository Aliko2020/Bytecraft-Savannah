          <h3>About Bytecraft Savannah</h3>
          <p>
            Bytecraft Savannah was born out of a personal journey a blend of
            passion, purpose, and a deep belief in the transformative power of
            technology.As someone with a lifelong fascination for computers, I
            was always drawn to how technology could solve problems and unlock
            new possibilities. This passion deepened during my National Service,
            where I served as a Teaching Assistant. It was there that I
            witnessed firsthand the impact of digital literacy. I wasnâ€™t just
            assisting with lessons I was helping students discover confidence,
            creativity, and career potential through basic computer skills. That
            experience revealed a clear gap and a greater opportunity. <br />
            Bytecraft Savannah was created to help bridge that gap and expand
            opportunity through tech.
